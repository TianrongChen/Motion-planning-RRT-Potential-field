# Motion-planning-RRT-Potential-field
Schedule trajectory to a car to reach the goal in extremely hard random maze.
Each method is combined with a readme in the folder.
The following is the maps:

Meanwhile, all the road will generate random obstacle. The car need to replan whenever it finds an obstacle. Here the car is not a point. It has its own size, and the motion planning also need to consider the feasibility.
